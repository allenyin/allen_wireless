In Makefile, there are several options that you can change, depending on what version of
headstage and what version of firmware is on those headstages.

Among the options HEADSTAGE_TIM, RADIO_BASIC, RADIO_AGC, RADIO_AGC_IIR, RADIO_AGC_IIR_SAA, only
one should be set to true, with the rest to false.

To compile gtkclient to use with older, RHA-based wireless headstages, set HEADSTAGE_TIM to true. And
make sure the RHA-headstage is loaded with firmware from "../headstage_firmware" with command:

    make clean; make; make flash

See the comments in its Makefile if error occurs.

The options RADIO_BASIC, RADIO_AGC, RADIO_AGC_IIR will compile gtkclient for testing the RHD-wireless
headstages with different firmware versions (see headstage2_firmware/README.txt for details).




To use with older, RHA-based wireless headstages, set "HEADSTAGE_TIM" to true in Makefile.
To use with the different RHD-based headstage firmware, set the corresponding directive to true
in Makefile (see "headstage2_firmware/README.txt" for details).orted spike templates are saved in configuration.bin. Note that these templates will only be 
saved if gtkclient is terminated by closing the GUI by clicking the "x" button. Using ctrl-c
will result in losing the newly sorted templates.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When gtkclient is compiled on a new system, upon launching it looks for configuration.bin, which
includes, among many things, sorted spike templates. If a configuration.bin does not exist, it
will create one on closing, including any sorted spike templates during that session.

If you want to use existing sorted templates from a different gtkclient (from another computer
or in a different folder), copy the configuration.bin file from that gtkclient to the current
gtklcient folder. Upon launching, the existing configuration.bin file will be read instead.

Note that the older, configuration files generated by different versions of gtkclient will not
be the same, and one might have to resort spikes.
